# Recipe Builder

I started this project to learn SolidJS and TailwindCSS. In the app you can create recipes from ingredients. It can then calculate the cost of the recipe.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, install npm packages:

```bash
cd recipe-builder
npm install
```

Then serve the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```
